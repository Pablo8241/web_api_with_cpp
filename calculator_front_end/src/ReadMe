// Commands to start React:                         Note: Do not include parenthesis when typing in the name.

// This Command is only done once when you have just started making your application:
// 1. npx create-react-app "Application Name"       Creates a new directory for your react app.

// These commands need to be executed every time you start up VS Code in order to see your application:
// 2. cd "Application Name"/                        Moves to the newly created directory.
// 3. npm start                                     Opens up a localhost window in your browser with your React application.
